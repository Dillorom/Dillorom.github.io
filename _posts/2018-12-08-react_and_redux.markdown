React/Redux are  new layers on JavaScript and  different ways of looking into things in the web development. React is mainly a view component of the MVC trio, that can go with a different MCs, but Reat itself alone can’t offer a full stack solution. That is why in my final project, I have Ruby on Rails in my back end that supports MC of the MVC trio.  React is mostly concerned about how things look, therefore taking control over the front-end. 

Redux is a small library that supports and improves working with React. React is good up until a certain point, and as the project expands, it becomes difficult to keep track of component props, and passing them all they day down becomes a tedious work. Redux offers a one-stop store solution, where all the properties can be stored and updated, and accessed from whatever components that needs to access to it. 

Like the AJAX technique, both React and Redux are asynchronous. React component lifecycles helps correctly figure out render and update a state of the component depending on user actions. 

React is a library build in JavaScript, but it also introduces a high-level language JSX that combines and simplifies both HTML and JavaScript. Once worked with JSX, one can become so used to it and like it, and wish everything else was as straightforward as JSX. React is also an imperative programming, where we don’t tell React how to do things. We just need to tell React what to do, and it will take care of the rest. 

Redux initially was little confusing to grasp. With Redux, we have one big store, where we store all component props. We can access them using` connect`. But that is not it. When a user interacts on the UI, actions are sent to a reducer, which makes appropriate changes to the store, and re-renders the state. 

If I can say one take away from working with React and Redux is that there are many creative ways to look at programming languages and achieving the same result in many ways. I think it is a human genius that these programming languages, libraries and frameworks were created, and we can create many amazing things on the web with a high-level abstract thinking.
