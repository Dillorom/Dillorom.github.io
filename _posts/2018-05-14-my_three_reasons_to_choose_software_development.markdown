There are three reasons why I chose to study software development. 

I love problem solving. As a lawyer, I worked to solve client’s existing problems, often under a time constraint and limited resources. As a financial planner, I dealt with my clients’ future problems. It is a case presented in front of you, and you solve the puzzle by serving to the best interest of the client. There several ways to get to the solution, and it’s your expertise and creativity that results in the most affordable, hassle-free and practically possible desired outcome. Since coding fundamentally involves problem solving and creativity, it resonated with me. 

Kids are curious by nature. My five-year-old can’t wait to find out what is in the present box. It is so painful for her to watch the box, and not be able to find out what is inside. Sometimes, she cries begging to get a clue about the present. That is why I started showing the present boxes only before she could open them. I may not cry in front of a puzzle, but the intensity is similar when it comes to finding out a way to solve it. 

Automation is growing, technology is taking over the professional fields. People can interpret it in different ways. I like how technology saves people’s time so that humans can ponder about important questions. I am fascinated how human intelligence reached to this point of development and wonder where it will reach by the end of my life. As this trend grows, I want to stay tuned and get closer to the field by being able to understand the languages and have necessary skills. I have already taken a peak in this field by taking online and some offline courses, where I tested out if nature of coding really feels like something I want to do as a job for at least another thirty-five years. My positive introduction made me move forward with enrolling in a full time online programming boot camp. 

On more practical level, I want to pursue a career in software development so that I can move around the country and be able to find a job. I think software development will offer me this opportunity as the demand for programmers is in the rise across the globe.
